```http
GET /workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/extractors/$EXTRACTOR_KEY/extracts?subject_id=$SUBJECT_ID HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

        "classification_id": 54376560,
        "created_at": "2017-05-16T20:37:39.124Z",
        "data": null,

```

Extracts are pieces of information relating to a specific classification (and therefore to a specific subject as well).

subject_id   | null     | **Required** &middot; Specifies which subject this extract is about
classification_id | null | **Required** &middot; Specifies which classification this extract is about.<br>May be omitted if known to be an update rather than a create.
